I am a PhD Student in the AI&ML group of Universitat Pompeu Fabra (https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) in  Barcelona. I work under the supervision of Gergely Neu and my main research interest is Sequential Decision Making and Reinforcement Learning. I was part of the organizing team of [RLSS 2023](https://rlsummerschool.com/), a reinforcement learning summer school.
