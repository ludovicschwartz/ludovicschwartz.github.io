I have graduated from the [Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage](https://www.master-mva.com/) and the [Mathématiques de
l'aléatoire](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/mathematiques-de-laleatoire/#anchor_0) masters and from the maths department of [École Normale Supérieure Paris](https://www.math.ens.psl.eu/en/welcome/). 
I am currently a PhD Student at the [AI&ML group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra  in  Barcelona. I work under the supervision of Gergely Neu and my main research interests are learning theory, online learning, Reinforcement learning, and Sequential Decision Making. I'm particularly interested in information based methods and instance-dependent guarantees.

### Infos

### News
* 12/24 : We're presenting a poster on [Bisimulation Metrics are Optimal Transport Distances, and Can be Computed Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04056) at [Neurips 2024](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024) in Vancouver. 
* 07/24 : We're presenting a poster on [Bisimulation Metrics are Optimal Transport Distances, and Can be Computed Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04056) at the [Aligning Reinforcement Learning Experimentalists and Theorists](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/workshop/29964) workshop at [ICML 2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) in Vienna .
* 07/24 : I've been invited to give a talk at the [Foundations of RL and Control](https://rl-control-theory.github.io/)
  workshop at [ICML 2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) in Vienna about our [Optistic Information Directed Sampling  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15411). [Slides](/slides/OIDS_COLT.html).
* 06/24 : I'm going to [COLT 2024](https://learningtheory.org/colt2024/) to present our work on Optimistic Information Directed Sampling. We are getting frequentist guarantees for the information directed Sampling in a very general setting by directly extending the Bayesian analysis through the use of an optimistic "Feel-Good" term. Moreover, our work is related to the Decision Estimation Coefficient litterature replacing a supremum with an expecatation which allows us to go beyond worst case guarantees. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15411). [Slides](/slides/OIDS_COLT.html).
* 05/24 : I'm visiting [Johannes Kirschner](https://johannes-kirschner.de/) for 3 months at the [Swiss Data Science
  Center](https://www.datascience.ch/). We are working on instance dependent guarantees for regret in Sequential
  Decision Making for information based algorithms.
* 07/23 : The videos of the lectures of RLSS2023 are available [on youtube](https://t.co/oSViqWwj6S).
* 06/23 : We are organizing the 2023 edition of the Reinforcement Learning Summer School in Barcelona : https://rlsummerschool.com/
* 12/22 : I'm going to Neurips to present our work on Lifting the information ratio. Essentially, we extend the
  existing information theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling to the contextual bandits problem by modifying the
  definition of information gain and information ratio.
* 10/21 : I'm starting a PhD in RL theory with [Gergely Neu](http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/) .
